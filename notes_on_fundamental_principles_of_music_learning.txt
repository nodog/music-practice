Extras - Bob Duke's Video Essays on Fundamental Principles of Effective Music Learning

- The Goal of Music Making
  - The goal from the very beginning should be -  How do I convey some
    idea to a listener?
  - This is the most important askpect of musical learning.
  - Expressiveness should be taught/learned/thought about from the very beginning.
  - The assumption is that the mechanics of music making are necessary
    first, but that is not true.

- Student Focus: The Listener
  - The focus of music training should be, from the very beginning, what
    you want the sound of your instrument to do for your listener.
  - This *is* a different way of thinking than when focused on what
    you/your teacher wants the instrument to do.
  - This is *not* different way of thinking about learning. Ex. When learning
    to ride a bike, the end goal is always in mind while performing
    any action.

- Goal-Directed Learning
  - Even random action, when placed in a goal-directed environment
    allows one to muddle around and discover actions that lead toward
    the goal.
  - Learning situations which "obviate error" create situations where
    the learner cannot "muddle around" and have real learning.
  - If the long term goal (ex. musical expression) remains only in the
    mind of the teacher, then things are being learned about the goal
    (ex. musical expression isn't important all the time), but perhaps
    not something productive toward the goal.
  - Even when playing simple patterns, one should be working to make
    them sound "beautiful" (or express the desired idea).

- Proper Sequencing: Baseball
  - When we teach baseball, we start by making the experience as much
    like baseball, but take away the one thing that's hard to do,
    swinging a stick at a moving target. We introduce tee ball.
    - Next we bring in "coach pitch", so now it's a predictable moving
      target.
    - Next, we teach the kids to pitch.
    - Then, we teach the kids to pitch balls that are difficult to hit.
    - Now, you're playing baseball for reals.
    - But, the whole experience has been playing baseball.
  - The music learning equivalent is to limit the physical difficulty
    of the initial chords and melodies in order to create the experience
    of music making (be expressive musically) from the very beginning.

- Fundamentals of Music Making
  - Musical expertise is a long journey.
  - At all points the fundamentals of instrument playing and of music
    making are of primary importance.
  - Playing any instrument (including singing) is predicated on relaxed
    efficient usage of the body.
  - The less a musician looks like they do when they're just having a
    conversation, the less efficient they're probably being with their
    resources.
  - This attention to fundamental physical motion and how to make that
    as efficient as possible should be an ongoing focus for both
    learners and teachers.
  - If you can't make a beautiful sound in a relaxed way in tune and in
    time, why would you start working on repetoire which doesn't allow
    you to do that.
  - When sitting down to practice, there should be a moment of
    self-reflection about the physical position of the body and instrument.
    - How am I positioned?
    - Is everything moving as I want?
    - Am I relaxed?
    - Am I comfortable?
    - Is the instrument in good condition?
    - Am I ready to play?
    - Do I have an idea about what sound I want to hear when I start?

- Refinement
  - When teaching anyone to play, we teach habit strength.
  - How do you habitually think about this? How do you habitually i
    physically do this?
  - The most undervalued aspect of effective teaching is redundancy.
  - Each new repetition of something allows us to practice thinking
    about it in a different way.
  - Refining the way I do what I do.
  - Teachers are generally good at inroducing learners to new ideas.
    Teachers are generally bad at refining ideast that learners have
    been introduced to in the past. Therefore the latter gets ignored.
  - The way a teacher then engages at the next level is to introduce
    another new idea instead of refining previous ideas.
  - Learning is error correction, specifically self error correction.
  - Learning is resolving the discrepancy between what happens and
    what you'd like to have happen.
  - If a teacher corrects every time something is done incorrectly, then
    the student learns that the process is do something and then get
    corrected by my teacher.
  - The reason for lessons though is to learn how to self-evaluate and
    be able to practice effectively. If the teacher can sit back and
    let the student figure out what needs to happen next, you create a
    different kind of learner.
  - This learner is a student who can make progress on their own.
  - If a student can't watch a student make progress on their own in the
    presence of a teacher, that student is probably not going to make
    progress on their own without the teacher.

- Error Correction
  - Error is a discrepancy between what you intended to have happen and
    what actually happened.
  - In order to do that, one must have an intention about what one wants
    to have happen.
  - It might seem inefficient to a teacher to let a student decide for
    themselves what they want to have happen and what the difference is
    between that and what they actually did.
  - One must value the muddle (as in muddling around), because that
    muddling is where the learning happens.
  - What needs to happen to make this physical, acoustic, or musical thing
    happen? That is the goal.
  - One way to make practice inefficient is to repeat many times without
    making discriminations between one repetition and the next.
  - When listening to an expert musician practice, you may hear 20-50
    repetitions of the same short phrase, which to a naive ear sound the
    same. These repetitions do *not* sound the same to the expert.
  - This means that practice is error correction for the beginner or expert
    according to the above definition.

- Joy
  - For any one who does anything very well, they are joyful in their work.
  - Many people who start playing music have the expectation that it will be
    a joyful experience.
  - The absence of joy from the very beginning is discouraging for many.
  - Those who are passionate about something experience primarily joy.
  - Superb teachers shape attitudes as well as skills and knowledge.
  - Primarily, music making should be joyful.
  - Sure, you gotta do the boring, tedious stuff to make music happen, but if
    those struggles are not highly goal-oriented and punctuated by joyful
    moments, then we're wasting our time.
  - Some big chunk (20%?) of lessons/practice should be uninterrupted, joyful music
    making. It shouldn't be mindless. It should be directed and work, but
    joyful.
  - If that doesn't happen, then it shouldn't be hard to understand why people
    become discouraged and put down the instruments.
