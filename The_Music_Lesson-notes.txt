notes from The Music Lesson by Victor Wooten

I did not love this book. It's got too much "magic" in it for me.
But it did have some good ideas about ways to practice and
  bring that extra something into playing.

I thought there were about 4 good things in this book.


He divides the Elements of Music into 10 categories:
- notes
  - harmony, melody, re-harmonization, scales, modes, chords, key signatures...
- articulation
- technique
- feel
- dynamics
- rhythm
- tone
- phrasing
- space
- listening

Everything other than notes is considered groove.
Notes and groove should be equally taught.

Learn music as a child learns language.
  - Play with masters and experts in the field all the time.
  - Do this by putting on music and playing along.

Dynamics can be used across multiple elements of music to give focus.

Metronome games -- Play with the metronome only on
  - the 1 & 3
  - the 2 & 4
  - the 1
  - the "and" of 1
  - the 2
    - move this through the whole measure by 16ths
  - the 1 of 2 bars
  - the 1 of 4 bars
  - the 1 of 8 bars
  - the 1 of 16 bars

Play music like a child does.
  - Go ahead and play without fear of anyone else judging you.
  - Know you are right by the understanding that there is no wrong.
    - Have the confidence of being right.
  - Play whenever you can.
